    "An autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to encode its inputs, often using much less data. It does so in a way that it can still output the original input with just the encoded values. For it to learn, it does not require \"labels\" as its output. Instead, it tries to output whatever it was given as input. So in goes an image, and out should also go the same image. But it has to be able to retain all the details of the image, even after possibly reducing the information down to just a few numbers."
